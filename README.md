# PTZ-Camera

Program for modeling behaviour of a Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) camera.

Functionalities lie in the scope of the following description:

1. Developed a PI control law in discrete-time for tracking target trajectory in FOV of Pan-Tilt-Zoom camera modeled on MATLAB.
2. Conceived Bayesian Belief Network and trained Logistic Regression Model to search target outside sensor FOV in discrete-time.
3. Maximized area of coverage with two cameras in the workspace by applying nonlinear optimization with kinematic constraints.
